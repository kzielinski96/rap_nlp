       " 'description': {'plain': 'A legendary hip-hop icon who started as an underground battle rapper in Detroit, Marshall “Eminem” Bruce Mathers III (1972 – present) has developed a career full of controversy, wild swings, and some of the most noteworthy raps in the history of the genre.\\n\\nEminem has broken countless barriers, shifting and impacting the culture in several ways. In June 2017, “Stan” was added into the Oxford Dictionary, and in 2019, to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. He was the first rapper to win the Grammy Award for Best Album for three consecutive albums. “Rap God” set the Guinness World Record for most words in a song. He was also the first rapper to win an Oscar. His albums The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show became certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2011, making him one of the few artists to have more than one Diamond album. This has helped him become the highest selling hip-hop artist of all time. In January 2020, with his 11th studio album Music to Be Murdered By debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200, Eminem became the first artist in history to have 10 consecutive #1 debuts.\\n\\nProduced and co-signed by Dr. Dre, Em had an unprecedented run of success from 1999 up until 2003, releasing three well-reviewed multi-platinum albums, stealing the show on countless collaborations, and even starred in a hit movie. However, it all came crashing down around 2004, when a string of problems ranging from drug dependence to depression to the tragic death of best friend Deshaun “Proof” Holton in 2006 led to a long hiatus from music and a pair of what were, by his own admission, sub-par albums.\\n\\nThis led to Em switching his style up from his previously shock-oriented lyrics to more emotional subject matters on the 2010s Recovery. This was a well-received and Grammy-award winning album, and he employed a very similar approach to 2013’s The Marshall Mathers LP 2, the well-received sequel to Em’s magnum opus.\\n\\nEminem invested himself farther than ever into this new emotional style with 2017’s  Revival, which included lyrics about his place in hip-hop, as well as modern issues including President Donald Trump. Despite the serious direction, many were turned off to the album due to its heavy Rock-sampling, with many considering it one of, if not his weakest project.\\n\\nFollowing the controversy surrounding Revival and criticism of his modern-style, Eminem surprise-released  Kamikaze on 31 August 2018, which responded to critics of Revival and his career overall. The album was received much better than his previous and went on to be the highest selling rap album of 2018.\\n\\nOnce again by surprise, Eminem released Music to Be Murdered By on 17 January 2020, being Eminem’s first full-length project for the new decade. The album, similar to 2018’s Kamikaze, includes fast-paced rapping and heavy rhyming. The album’s cover is a reference to Sir Alfred Hitchcock, and his 1958 debut album Music to Be Murdered By. In December 2020, Em released Music to Be Murdered By: Side B. This deluxe edition includes 16 new tracks that were not on the original tracklist.\\n\\nHe has an extensive list of hit singles; some of the most popular include “Without Me,” “Lose Yourself,” “Stan,” “The Real Slim Shady,” “Mockingbird,” “When I’m Gone,” “Love the Way You Lie,” “Not Afraid,” “The Monster,” “Rap God” and “River.”\\n\\nEm is one half of Bad Meets Evil with Royce Da 5\\'9\", and was a part of D12 with Mr. Porter, Kuniva, Swifty McVay, and Bizarre, and formerly with Proof, Bugz & Fuzz Scoota.\\n\\nEminem founded Shady Records in 1999 after the success of The Slim Shady LP and served as the label’s president along with his manager, Paul Rosenberg.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs of February 8, 2018, Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” is officially certified diamond in the United States, meaning the song has sold over 10 million copies. It’s Eminem’s third diamond single after “Not Afraid” and “Love the Way You Lie.\" Eminem is now the first rapper and only the second artist to ever achieve this accolade.'},\n",

I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck\\nThrough the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it\\nLike G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up\\nAnd if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut\\nAnd I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook\\nMe for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself\\nWith a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt\\n'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut\\nI get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut\\n'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust\\nIt'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what\\nGot me this far, picture me quittin'\\nNow draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!\\nIt's survival of what?\\n\\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]\\nThis is survival of the fittest\\nThis is do or die\\nThis is the winner takes it all\\nSo, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all\\nSo, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all\\n\\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\\n(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo\\nBut don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle\\nThis is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit\\nLive, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this\\nRefuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick\\nI don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit\\nAin't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do\\nAs soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit\\nBut my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do\\n'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit\\nSo there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade\\nSo you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es\\n'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me\\nSo, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!\\nBut I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve\\n'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed\\nAnd if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem\\nMust be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me\\nMy skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me\\nI can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be\\nAllergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it\\nI just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!\\n\\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]\\nThis is survival of the fittest\\nThis is do or die\\nThis is the winner takes it all\\nSo, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all\\nSo, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all\"},\n",

all my fault anyway, she\\'s turnin\\' the tables, I\\'m a beat-break\\nShe treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ\\nEach day is an Instant Replay\\nThey say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior\\nBack together, but forgot today was her B-day\\nShe cut me off on the freeway\\nSimple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes\\nThat\\'s when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait\\nBitch cut my fuckin\\' brakeline\\nStepped on them fuckers eight times\\nStill goin\\' seventy-three, thank God there\\'s an exit comin\\' up\\nWhat the

me, eh?\\nSnatch that bitch out her car through the window\\nShe screamin\\', I body slam her on the cement\\nUntil the concrete gave and created a sinkhole\\nBuried the stink ho in it, then paid to

Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)\\nSing it with me, it's just for today\\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\\n\\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\\nEntertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters\\nIn the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum\\nHoly or unholy, only have one homie\\nOnly this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me\\nYet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)\\nI guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great\\nOr they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate\\nIt's like these kids hang on every single statement we make\\nLike they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum\\nNow how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?\\nFrom standin' on corners and porches just rappin'\\nTo havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass\\nBut then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you\\nFans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you\\nTo get they hands on every dime you have\\nThey want you to lose your mind every time you mad\\nSo they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon\\nAny dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns\\nThat's why these prosecutors wanna convict me\\nStrictly just to get me off of these streets quickly\\nBut all they kids be listenin' to me religiously\\nSo I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me\\nThey're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me\\nIf I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B\\nIt's all political, if my music is literal\\nAnd I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?\\nI couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to\\nYou're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)\\n\\n[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]\\n(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)\\nSing it with me, it's just for today\\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\\n\\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\\nThey say music can alter moods and talk to you\\nWell, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?\\nWell, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude\\nJust tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued\\nSee, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols\\nAnd they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool\\nNot knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves\\nWe entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales\\nYou ignoramus, but music is reflection of self\\nWe just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail\\nIt's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'\\nTo bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted\\nThat's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing\\nExcept for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)\\nWho post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long\\nIdolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs\\nOr for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives\\nSo they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die\\n'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe\\nWe're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes\\nThat's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it\\nSqueeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden\\nAnd maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits\\nLive on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…\\n\\n[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]\\nSing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)\\nSing it with me, it's just for today\\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\\n\\n[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]\\nSing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)\\nSing it with me, it's just for today\\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\"},\n",

through the roof\\nWe wrote and we feuded, Runyon Avenue soldiers included\\nA multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse\\nWe were so bulletproof—wrote, souped and soaked in our youth\\nThought we was runnin\\' shit \\'til we lost the sole of our shoe\\nThe death of Doody broke us in two\\nWe were thrown for a loop, ain\\'t none of us know what to do\\nAnd at the time I was goin\\' through my own struggles too\\nSo I wasn\\'t in no condition to be coachin\\' us through\\nEveryone tried to go solo, really nobody blew\\nI was hopin\\' they do, so I ain\\'t have to shoulder the crew\\nThe plan was put everyone in position so that they knew\\nHow to stand on their own, and I don\\'t wanna open up wounds\\nI just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth\\n\\'Cause the truth is, the moment that Proof died, so did the group\\nShoot!\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus: Eminem, Mario Resto & Both]\\nIf I could leave this all behind\\nI could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\\nDown to the river with you\\nHelp me leave this all behind\\n\\n[Chorus: Eminem]\\nI\\'ma wash away my sins\\nI\\'ma rinse away this dirt\\nI forgot to make amends\\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\\nI better stop and say my grace\\nFrom it I pray that I don\\'t fall\\n\\'Cause on the way back down I may\\nEnd up runnin\\' back into them all\\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\\n\\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\\nIt was never the same, and it\\'s bothered me since\\nAnd the farther we drift apart, the more awkward it gets\\nThe more time goes by, the more life happens\\nAnd we gotta be men, we got responsibilities\\nPlus we don\\'t say how we feel\\nAnd I feel like this is what got us in the debacle we\\'re in\\nBeen with you guys thick and thin\\nBut it\\'s almost as if sometimes we\\'re not even friends\\nWhich reminded me, Biz, \"Rockstar\" was the shit\\nY\\'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit\\nIf you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did\\nMore than try talkin\\' you into comin\\' up off of it\\nI know it wasn\\'t my fault, but part of it probably is\\nI think of all of the trips to BET\\nAnd the rappers I wish that we woulda politicked with\\nMaybe y\\'all coulda clicked and got you some features\\nBut that\\'s water under the bridge\\nBut I\\'m washin\\' my sins in it \\'til my conscience is cleansed\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus: Eminem, Mario Resto & Both]\\nIf I could leave this all behind\\nI could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line\\nDown to the river with you\\nHelp me leave this all behind\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nI\\'ma wash away my sins\\nI\\'ma rinse away this dirt\\nI forgot to make amends\\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\\nI better stop and say my grace\\nFrom it I pray that I don\\'t fall\\n\\'Cause on the way back down I may\\nEnd up runnin\\' back into them all\\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\\n\\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\\nBacardi and Hen\\', never thought the party would end\\nOne minute you\\'re bodyin\\' shit, but then your audience splits\\nYou can already sense the climate is startin\\' to shift\\nTo these kids you no longer exist\\nWent from rainin\\' cats and dogs in this bitch\\nTo tiny drops, little drips\\nAnd by the time your reign is over, you\\'ll hardly be missed\\nYou start thinkin\\' of all the artists you dissed\\nAll the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get\\nFor turnin\\' your fuckin\\' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?\\nA Freudian slip, subconsciously, I honestly wished\\nI ain\\'t feel so much guilt and y\\'all didn\\'t harbor resentment\\nBut it\\'s hard to pretend that y\\'all ain\\'t got none\\nI just wish I had words, but I guess there just are none for this\\nTo my partners, I can\\'t say how sorry I am\\nThis is not how I planned for our story to end\\nI love all of you men\\nBut I just can\\'t be the guy everybody depends\\nOn for entire careers \\'cause that\\'s not even fair\\nI will always be here, but that spark isn\\'t there\\nAnd I don\\'t know how to recapture that time and that era\\nI\\'ve tried hearkening back to, but I\\'m fightin\\' for air\\nI\\'m barely chartin\\' myself\\nFeels like I\\'m on the descent, but it was not my intent\\nTo treat y\\'all like a stepping stone\\nThough I ain\\'t left no one behind, but we been down every road\\nDone all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up\\nBut the longer we spend livin\\' this lie that we live\\nThe less is left for closure, so let\\'s let this go\\nIt\\'s not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over\\n\\n[Chorus: Eminem]\\nI\\'ma wash away my sins\\nI\\'ma rinse away this dirt\\nI forgot to make amends\\nTo all the friends I may have hurt\\nI better stop and say my grace\\nFrom it I pray that I don\\'t fall\\n\\'Cause on the way back down I may\\nEnd up runnin\\' back into them all\\nI never meant to use you all as my stepping stones\\n\\n[Outro: Eminem]\\nI never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones\\nI never meant to use you all for my stepping stones'},\n",

       "'A legendary hip-hop icon who started as an underground battle rapper in Detroit, Marshall “Eminem” Bruce Mathers III (1972 – present) has developed a career full of controversy, wild swings, and some of the most noteworthy raps in the history of the genre.\\n\\nEminem has broken countless barriers, shifting and impacting the culture in several ways. In June 2017, “Stan” was added into the Oxford Dictionary, and in 2019, to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. He was the first rapper to win the Grammy Award for Best Album for three consecutive albums. “Rap God” set the Guinness World Record for most words in a song. He was also the first rapper to win an Oscar. His albums The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show became certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2011, making him one of the few artists to have more than one Diamond album. This has helped him become the highest selling hip-hop artist of all time. In January 2020, with his 11th studio album Music to Be Murdered By debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200, Eminem became the first artist in history to have 10 consecutive #1 debuts.\\n\\nProduced and co-signed by Dr. Dre, Em had an unprecedented run of success from 1999 up until 2003, releasing three well-reviewed multi-platinum albums, stealing the show on countless collaborations, and even starred in a hit movie. However, it all came crashing down around 2004, when a string of problems ranging from drug dependence to depression to the tragic death of best friend Deshaun “Proof” Holton in 2006 led to a long hiatus from music and a pair of what were, by his own admission, sub-par albums.\\n\\nThis led to Em switching his style up from his previously shock-oriented lyrics to more emotional subject matters on the 2010s Recovery. This was a well-received and Grammy-award winning album, and he employed a very similar approach to 2013’s The Marshall Mathers LP 2, the well-received sequel to Em’s magnum opus.\\n\\nEminem invested himself farther than ever into this new emotional style with 2017’s  Revival, which included lyrics about his place in hip-hop, as well as modern issues including President Donald Trump. Despite the serious direction, many were turned off to the album due to its heavy Rock-sampling, with many considering it one of, if not his weakest project.\\n\\nFollowing the controversy surrounding Revival and criticism of his modern-style, Eminem surprise-released  Kamikaze on 31 August 2018, which responded to critics of Revival and his career overall. The album was received much better than his previous and went on to be the highest selling rap album of 2018.\\n\\nOnce again by surprise, Eminem released Music to Be Murdered By on 17 January 2020, being Eminem’s first full-length project for the new decade. The album, similar to 2018’s Kamikaze, includes fast-paced rapping and heavy rhyming. The album’s cover is a reference to Sir Alfred Hitchcock, and his 1958 debut album Music to Be Murdered By. In December 2020, Em released Music to Be Murdered By: Side B. This deluxe edition includes 16 new tracks that were not on the original tracklist.\\n\\nHe has an extensive list of hit singles; some of the most popular include “Without Me,” “Lose Yourself,” “Stan,” “The Real Slim Shady,” “Mockingbird,” “When I’m Gone,” “Love the Way You Lie,” “Not Afraid,” “The Monster,” “Rap God” and “River.”\\n\\nEm is one half of Bad Meets Evil with Royce Da 5\\'9\", and was a part of D12 with Mr. Porter, Kuniva, Swifty McVay, and Bizarre, and formerly with Proof, Bugz & Fuzz Scoota.\\n\\nEminem founded Shady Records in 1999 after the success of The Slim Shady LP and served as the label’s president along with his manager, Paul Rosenberg.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs of February 8, 2018, Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” is officially certified diamond in the United States, meaning the song has sold over 10 million copies. It’s Eminem’s third diamond single after “Not Afraid” and “Love the Way You Lie.\" Eminem is now the first rapper and only the second artist to ever achieve this accolade.'"

However, it all came crashing down around 2004, when a string of problems ranging from drug dependence to depression to the tragic death of best friend Deshaun “Proof” Holton in 2006 led to a long hiatus from music and a pair of what were, by his own admission, sub-par albums.\n",
      "\n",
      "This led to Em switching his style up from his previously shock-oriented lyrics to more emotional subject matters on the 2010s Recovery. This was a well-received and Grammy-award winning album, and he employed a very similar approach to 2013’s The Marshall Mathers LP 2, the well-received sequel to Em’s magnum opus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eminem invested himself farther than ever into this new emotional style with 2017’s  Revival, which included lyrics about his place in hip-hop, as well as modern issues including President Donald Trump. Despite the serious direction, many were turned off to the album due to its heavy Rock-sampling, with many considering it one of, if not his weakest project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the controversy surrounding Revival and criticism of his modern-style, Eminem surprise-released  Kamikaze on 31 August 2018, which responded to critics of Revival and his career overall. The album was received much better than his previous and went on to be the highest selling rap album of 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once again by surprise, Eminem released Music to Be Murdered By on 17 January 2020, being Eminem’s first full-length project for the new decade. The album, similar to 2018’s Kamikaze, includes fast-paced rapping and heavy rhyming. The album’s cover is a reference to Sir Alfred Hitchcock, and his 1958 debut album Music to Be Murdered By. In December 2020, Em released Music to Be Murdered By: Side B. This deluxe edition includes 16 new tracks that were not on the original tracklist.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has an extensive list of hit singles; some of the most popular include “Without Me,” “Lose Yourself,” “Stan,” “The Real Slim Shady,” “Mockingbird,” “When I’m Gone,” “Love the Way You Lie,” “Not Afraid,” “The Monster,” “Rap God” and “River.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Em is one half of Bad Meets Evil with Royce Da 5'9\", and was a part of D12 with Mr. Porter, Kuniva, Swifty McVay, and Bizarre, and formerly with Proof, Bugz & Fuzz Scoota.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eminem founded Shady Records in 1999 after the success of The Slim Shady LP and served as the label’s president along with his manager, Paul Rosenberg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As of February 8, 2018, Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” is officially certified diamond in the United States, meaning the song has sold over 10 million copies. It’s Eminem’s third diamond single after “Not Afraid” and “Love the Way You Lie.\" Eminem is now the first rapper and only the second artist to ever achieve this accolade.\n"
